### Running the app

The app is developed using [Ember CLI](http://ember-cli.com). It requires nodejs
with npm installed.

In order to run the app you need to install dependencies with:

    bower install
    npm install

Now you can run the server:

    ember serve

And open http://localhost:4200 in the browser.

### Running tests

To run a test suite execute:

    ember test

You can also start an interactive test runner for easier development:

    ember test --serve
