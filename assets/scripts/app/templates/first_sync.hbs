  <h3>Just one more thing...</h3>

  <p>
    We're almost done getting you on board, just a few more seconds as we talk to GitHub to find out which
    repositories belong to you.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're part of an organization that already has repositories set up on Travis CI, we'll take you to the list
    once we're done.
  </p>

  <p>
    If this is your first time on Travis CI, and you're not part of any existing organizations yet, we'll take you to
    a handy getting started guide to get you off the ground quickly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now hold tight while we sync the last bits from GitHub, we should be done here any minute now.
  </p>

    <h3>Great news!</h3>
    <p>
      We've successfully synchronized your details from GitHub. We will redirect you to your profile in a few seconds.
