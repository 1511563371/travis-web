    It looks like we don't have sufficient privileges for your GitHub account.<br/>
    This can happen for different reasons, most commonly due to an older token<br/>
    stored on our end, or because some of the permissions have been removed<br/>
    from the token. Unfortunately we need those to provide you with the best service.<br/>
    <br/>
    Luckily, the issue can be easily corrected by going through the login flow<br/>
    once again. Make sure the permissions we ask for are all available.<br/>
    <br/>
    For more information about the OAuth scopes and what we need them for,<br/>
    [check our documentation on this topic](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/github-oauth-scopes/).
