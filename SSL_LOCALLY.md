Sometimes there is a need to test the app with an SSL connection, for example for
testing pusher on Travis CI Pro.

In order to run the app with SSL enabled you need to:

* generate self signed certificate as described here: https://gist.github.com/trcarden/3295935
  * one difference is that you need to use localhost.ssl, because travis-api
    doesn't whitelist localhost.ssl at the moment
* run ruby server with `SSL=true TRAVIS_PRO=true waiter/script/server`
* run Ember app in build mode only `TRAVIS_PRO=true ember build --watch`

Now open the app on whatever port ruby server is running (3001 by default). The
ruby app will serve files generated by `ember build` and it will allow SSL
connections
